# my-HTML-CSS-projects
A front-end replica of the YouTube homepage created using only HTML and CSS. This project showcases responsive layout design, grid-based content alignment, and styling techniques that closely mimic the original YouTube interface. It includes a navigation bar, sidebar, video thumbnails, and channel info all built from scratch without frameworks.
